                                Real Experiences)</h1>

                            <p class="text main">
                                As an Indian living in Sweden for over a decade, sending money back home has been a constant
                                part of life — whether it’s to help family, invest in something meaningful, or take care of
                                emergencies. Over the years, I’ve tried multiple remittance services, and I've also spoken
                                with friends across Sweden — in Västerås, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Uppsala — to
                                gather real feedback.

                                Here are the <b>Top 5 Remittance Services</b> we recommend for sending money from Sweden to
                                India, based on speed, exchange rates, reliability, and our lived experience.

                                        I’ve been using Wise since 2017. What I love is that the amount shown on the screen
                                        is exactly what gets delivered — no surprises.
